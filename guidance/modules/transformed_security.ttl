    1. Store private keys with 600 permissions

    3. Use PKCS#8 format for private keys
    4. Use environment variables for sensitive data
    5. Implement regular key rotation
    6. NEVER delete .env or configuration files without verified backup
    7. ALWAYS get explicit confirmation before key deletion
    8. AVAILABILITY IS CRITICAL - Security must not break functionality
    9. Maintain working access to all essential credentials
    10. Balance security measures against operational needs
    11. TRACK ALL SLA VIOLATIONS AS SECURITY INCIDENTS
    12. Test security measures against SLA requirements
    13. Regular SLA compliance auditing required
