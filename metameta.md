# MetaMeta Core Ontology

## Overview

The MetaMeta Core Ontology (version 1.0) provides the highest level of abstraction in the ontology framework. It defines fundamental concepts for organizing knowledge and managing abstraction hierarchies across all other ontologies.

## Core Concepts

### Abstraction Framework

The ontology centers around two key concepts:

- **AbstractionDimension**: Defines axes along which knowledge can be abstracted
- **AbstractionLevel**: Represents specific levels within each dimension

These concepts enable systematic organization of knowledge across different levels of abstraction.

### Knowledge Organization

The `KnowledgeDomain` class provides a foundation for:

- Organizing distinct areas of knowledge
- Defining domain boundaries
- Managing cross-domain relationships

## Properties

### Core Relationships

1. **Structural Properties**

   - `hasLevel`: Links dimensions to their levels
   - `levelNumber`: Provides ordinal positioning of levels
   - `domainScope`: Defines the scope of knowledge domains

### Constraints

- Minimum cardinality of 1 for levels in a dimension
- Integer-based level numbering
- String-based domain scope definitions

## Metadata

The ontology includes rich metadata:

- Creation and modification dates
- Licensing information (MIT)
- Publisher details
- Conformance to OWL
- Part of the broader Ontology Framework Project

## TODO

1. **Enhanced Abstraction Framework**

   - Add level transition rules
   - Define standard dimensions
   - Include validation constraints

2. **Knowledge Domain Enhancement**

   - Add domain relationship types
   - Include overlap management
   - Define boundary conditions

3. **Integration Mechanisms**

   - Add explicit mapping to meta ontology
   - Define cross-domain bridges
   - Include compatibility rules

4. **Validation Framework**

   - Add SHACL shapes
   - Include consistency rules
   - Define usage constraints

## Issues Found

1. **Abstraction Framework Gaps**

   - No explicit level transition rules
   - Missing standard dimensions
   - Limited validation constraints

2. **Domain Management**

   - Incomplete domain relationship model
   - No overlap handling
   - Missing boundary definitions

3. **Integration Issues**

   - Limited connection to meta ontology
   - No explicit domain bridges
   - Missing compatibility rules

## Best Practices

When using this ontology:

1. Define clear abstraction dimensions
2. Number levels consistently
3. Document domain scopes explicitly
4. Consider cross-domain implications
5. Maintain abstraction hierarchies

## Integration Guidelines

1. **With Meta Ontology**

   - Use consistent abstraction dimensions
   - Align domain concepts
   - Maintain hierarchical integrity

2. **With Domain Ontologies**

   - Define clear abstraction levels
   - Document domain boundaries
   - Handle overlaps explicitly

## Conclusion

The MetaMeta Core Ontology provides crucial high-level organization concepts but requires enhancement in several areas. Focus should be on strengthening the abstraction framework and improving domain management while maintaining its role as the highest-level organizing structure.
