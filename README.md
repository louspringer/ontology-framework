# Ontology Framework

A flexible ontology framework designed to leverage LLMs for semantic constraint enforcement and rich domain modeling capabilities, with lossless transformations between modeling formats.

## Overview

This framework provides:

- Semantic constraint enforcement for LLM responses
- Rich domain modeling with lossless transformations
- Tiered architecture promoting reuse
- Extensible model structures
- Multi-format projections (Turtle, UML, ERD, etc.)

## Installation

> **Note:** This project is currently in early development. The Python implementation is not yet available - see the [TODO section](#todo) for planned features and progress tracking.


```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate ontology-framework
```
