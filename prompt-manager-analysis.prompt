   - Component relationships

3. Map the system architecture:
   - Component hierarchy
   - Data flow
   - Service dependencies
   - External interfaces

4. Note planned extensions from TODO section

Please provide a clear, structured analysis focusing on practical implementation details and system architecture. Avoid recursive analysis of the ontology structure itself.
