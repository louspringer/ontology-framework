    From an era when:
    - Memory was a shared mystery
    - Types were more suggestion than law
    - Comments were both warning and poetry
    - Understanding was passed down like folklore
    - And sometimes, nobody knew why it worked
    
    But it did work.
    Until it didn't.
    And then you called Bob.
