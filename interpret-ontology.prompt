I have a Turtle ontology file describing audio systems, streaming, and processing 
tools. Please load and analyze the file, checking for self-descriptive metadata 
such as comments or labels that explain its purpose, core concepts, and how it 
models relationships like audio sources, processing hubs, and outputs. Summarize 
its intent and highlight key elements or patterns described in the file.
