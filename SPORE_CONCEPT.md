# The Spore Concept in Ontology Governance

## What is a Spore?
A **spore** is a modular, traceable unit of ontology change or governance pattern. Inspired by biological spores, it is designed to be small, self-contained, and able to propagate new structure or rules within a knowledge graph or ontology ecosystem.

## Motivation
- **Modularity:** Encapsulate governance or transformation patterns as discrete, reusable units.
- **Traceability:** Ensure every change or rule can be traced to a specific spore instance, supporting auditability and compliance.
- **Governance:** Encode not just ontology structure, but also the rules for validation, patching, and conformance.
- **Automation:** Enable automated validation, patching, and conformance tracking for continuous ontology governance.

## Key Features
- **Pattern Registration:** Each spore is registered as a `meta:TransformationPattern` and must be properly typed and documented.
- **SHACL Validation:** Spores must have associated SHACL shapes for structural and semantic validation.
- **Patch Support:** Spores support patch distribution and propagation via `meta:distributesPatch` and `meta:ConceptPatch`.
- **Conformance Tracking:** Spores track conformance violations and remediation via `meta:confirmedViolation` and related properties.
- **History and Versioning:** Spores maintain a history of changes, violations, and remediations for robust governance.

## How Spores Fit Into the Validation Framework
- The validation framework checks that every spore:
  - Is registered and typed correctly
  - Has associated SHACL shapes and validation rules
  - Supports runtime patching and conformance tracking
  - Maintains a history of violations and remediations
- This ensures that ontology changes and governance patterns are:
  - Modular and reusable
  - Traceable and auditable
  - Governed by explicit, machine-checkable rules

## Example Use Cases
- Registering a new transformation pattern for an ontology
- Validating that all required governance rules are present and enforced
- Propagating and tracking patches or corrections across a knowledge graph
- Auditing conformance and remediation history for compliance

- See the main [README.md](./README.md) for usage and validation steps.
- For implementation details, review the `spore_validation` module and related ontology files.
