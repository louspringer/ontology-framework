# Modeling Response Ontology v3

A pragmatic, non-normative ontology response to Dr. Milanović's 2025 software job collapse post. Because sometimes you need to model the future before it models you.

## 🎯 What's Inside

- **Cross-cutting concerns** modeled as first-class citizens
- **SPARQL queries** that actually work (we tested them, promise)
- **One-shot LLM prompts** because who has time for fine-tuning?
- **Metadata** tracking token costs, modeling duration, and session reflections
- A reference to the "50 cent shell script" because legacy code is forever

## 📁 Structure

```
modeling-response-ontology-v3/
├── ontology/           # The good stuff
├── metadata/          # Token counts and session logs
└── prompts/          # One-shot wonders
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Load the ontology:
```turtle
@prefix : <./ontology/modeling-response-ontology.ttl#> .
```

2. Run a SPARQL query:
```sparql
SELECT ?advice ?concern
WHERE {
    ?advice :addresses ?concern .
}
```

3. Use with ChatGPT:
- Copy the contents of `prompts/one-shot-start.txt`
- Paste into your favorite LLM interface
- Watch the magic happen

No bureaucracy, just good modeling practices.

## 🎨 Style Guide

- Relative IRIs: Because absolute paths are so 2010
- Local imports: Keep it close to home
- Modular namespacing: Like LEGO for ontologies
- A touch of sarcasm: Because why not?

- Dr. Milanović's original post (you know the one)
