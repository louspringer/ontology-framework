        Initial connection issues with GraphDB:
        1. Connection refused errors
        2. Authentication issues
        3. Repository path confusion
        4. 415 errors on SPARQL queries

    spore:resolution """
        1. Verified GraphDB running on port 7200
        2. Confirmed guidance ontology uploaded to 'guidance' repository
        3. Updated configuration:
           - Added repository configuration to bfg9k_config.ttl
           - Updated .cursor/mcp.json with environment variables
           - Fixed URL format to include repository path

        1. Successfully validated guidance.ttl
        2. Successfully executed SPARQL queries
        3. Retrieved class definitions and rules

    spore:recommendations """
        1. Always include repository path in GraphDB URL
        2. Verify repository exists before attempting connection
        3. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
        4. Test both validation and query functionality
        5. Consider adding more specific modeling rules to guidance ontology

        Questions for review:
        1. Should we standardize the URL format in configuration?
        2. Do we need additional validation rules?
        3. Should we add more test coverage for GraphDB connections?
        4. How can we improve error handling for connection issues?
