# Conda Cleanup Protocol

This rule ensures the Conda environment `boldo-ensemble` is safely removed without being active.

## Steps

```bash
if [[ "$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV" == "boldo-ensemble" ]]; then
  echo "⚠️ Cannot delete active environment. Switching to base..."
  conda deactivate
fi

conda remove --name boldo-ensemble --all -y
```
