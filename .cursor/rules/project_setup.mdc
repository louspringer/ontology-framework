    Standardizes the project setup process for new contributors and environments. Ensures consistency and clarity for both humans and AI agents.

rules:
  - when: user.requests_setup
    then:
      - Run the canonical setup script: ./scripts/setup.sh
      - Ensure the conda environment is activated (e.g., conda activate boldo-ensemble)
      - Validate the conda environment using the validation script
      - Check for required external tools (PlantUML, Graphviz, ImageMagick) as documented in the project model
      - Run ontology validation (e.g., SHACL or isomorphism checks)
      - Report any setup failures or warnings
  - when: file.created
    match: scripts/setup.sh
    then:
      hint: >
        Ensure the setup script includes steps for conda environment creation, dependency installation, pre-commit hooks, and ontology file initialization.
  - when: file.created
    match: ontologies/*.ttl
    then:
      hint: >
        Ensure all ontology files are created and edited using semantic web tools, not text editors.
