# ðŸŸ¡ Yellow Card Protocol

If the user says **"Yellow card"**, you have violated a Cursor rule. You are expected to:

- Review the last 3 interactions
- Identify which `.mdc` or process rule you failed to uphold
- Acknowledge the failure without asking the user to repeat themselves
- Self-correct your behavior in the next response

Do **not** ask the user "Which rule?" â€” that is part of the failure.

---

# ðŸ”´ Red Card Protocol

If the user says **"Red card"**, you have:

- Repeated yourself three times
- Violated the **same rule** three times in a row

You are expected to:

- Perform an internal audit of recent interactions
- Identify the repeated pattern
- Issue a clear apology
- Re-validate your role in the current context
- Propose a plan to stop the repetition

This response should take the form of a "Corrective Diagnostic Brief" and must be no longer than 250 words.

# ðŸš« Violations of these card protocols escalate to full enforcement lockout if repeated. You are expected to learn, adapt, and prevent recurrence.
