# Mighty Mouse Naming System

A systematic approach for generating memorable, thematic names using the Mighty Mouse universe. This system follows a Docker-style naming pattern while maintaining consistency with the Mighty Mouse theme.

## Structure

Each name consists of three parts:
1. **Adjective**: A descriptive word (e.g., Valiant, Mighty, Fearless)
2. **Adverb**: A modifier (e.g., Swiftly, Boldly, Quickly)
3. **Noun**: A character or element from Mighty Mouse (e.g., Mouse, Oilcan, Pearl)

## Identifiers

Each composite name includes:
- **Three-letter abbreviation**: Unique identifier (e.g., VSM, MBO, FQP)
- **Mnemonic**: Memorable uppercase reference (e.g., VALORMOUSE, MIGHTYOIL)

## Examples

| Full Name | Abbreviation | Mnemonic |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Valiant-Swiftly-Mouse | VSM | VALORMOUSE |
| Mighty-Boldly-Oilcan | MBO | MIGHTYOIL |
| Fearless-Quickly-Pearl | FQP | FEARLESSPEARL |
| Cosmic-Justly-Kitty | CJK | COSMICKITTY |
| Brave-Wisely-Scrappy | BWS | BRAVESCRAPPY |
| Dashing-Nimbly-Hero | DNH | DASHINGHERO |
| Clever-Swiftly-Terror | CST | CLEVERTERROR |
| Atomic-Rapidly-Cat | ARC | ATOMICCAT |
| Super-Proudly-Trouble | SPT | SUPERTROUBLE |
| Heroic-Greatly-Oil | HGO | HEROICOIL |

## Usage

1. Select components from each category (Adjective, Adverb, Noun)
2. Combine with hyphens: `{Adjective}-{Adverb}-{Noun}`
3. Create abbreviation using first letters: `{A}{A}{N}`
4. Generate mnemonic: uppercase reference capturing the essence of the name

## Ontology

The naming system is formally defined in `mu_names.ttl` with:
- Component hierarchies
- Relationship definitions
- Validation rules
- Extensibility patterns

## Future Enhancements

- Add character-specific adjectives from episodes
- Include episode references
- Add validation rules for combinations
- Create categories (heroes, villains, locations)
- Define relationship patterns between components
