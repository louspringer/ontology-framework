# Core Meta Ontology

## Overview

The Core Meta Ontology (version 1.0) provides fundamental concepts shared across all domain ontologies in the framework. It establishes basic building blocks for modeling people, positions, and abstraction dimensions.

## Core Concepts

### Person and Position

The ontology defines two fundamental entity types:

- **Person**: Represents human beings
- **Position**: Represents roles or positions that can be held by people

The relationship between these is captured through the `hasPosition` property, with a cardinality constraint ensuring a person can hold at most one position.

### Abstraction

The `AbstractionDimension` class provides a foundation for modeling different levels of abstraction across the ontology framework. This is a crucial concept that bridges to the meta-meta level concepts.

## Integration Points

This ontology serves as a foundation for:
- Higher-level domain ontologies
- Meta-meta level abstractions
- Cross-domain concept sharing

## TODO

1. **Enhanced Person Modeling**
   - Add properties for person attributes
   - Include temporal aspects of positions
   - Define relationship types

2. **Abstraction Framework**
   - Define standard abstraction dimensions
   - Add level hierarchies
   - Include transition rules

3. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Add explicit bridges to domain ontologies
   - Define cross-cutting concerns
   - Include validation rules

4. **Documentation**
   - Add more examples
   - Include usage patterns
   - Document best practices

## Issues Found

1. **Missing Concepts**
   - No temporal aspects for positions
   - Limited person attributes
   - Incomplete abstraction framework

2. **Integration Gaps**
   - Limited connection to metameta concepts
   - No explicit domain bridges
   - Missing validation rules

3. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Limited examples
   - No usage guidelines
   - Missing best practices

## Best Practices

When using this ontology:

1. Always define clear position types
2. Consider temporal aspects when modeling relationships
3. Use abstraction dimensions consistently
4. Document extensions and specializations
5. Validate against core constraints

## Conclusion

The Core Meta Ontology provides essential building blocks but needs enhancement in several areas. Focus should be on expanding the abstraction framework and strengthening integration points while maintaining its role as a lightweight foundation.
