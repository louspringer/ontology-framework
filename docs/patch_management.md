# Patch Management System

## Overview

The patch management system provides a robust way to manage and apply changes to ontologies while maintaining version control and validation. The system is designed to be consistent with the guidance ontology and follows semantic web best practices.

## Key Features

### 1. Patch Types and Status

- **Patch Types**:
  - ADD: Add new ontology elements
  - MINOR: Minor version updates
  - MAJOR: Major version updates
  - CRITICAL: Critical fixes
  - SECURITY: Security patches
  - And more specialized types for different use cases

- **Patch Status**:
  - DRAFT: Initial state
  - REVIEW: Under review
  - APPROVED: Approved for application
  - APPLIED: Successfully applied
  - FAILED: Application failed
  - And more statuses for tracking patch lifecycle

### 2. Patch Management

The `PatchManager` class provides the following functionality:

```python
# Create a new patch
patch = patch_manager.create_patch(
    patch_id="unique-id",
    description="Patch description",
    patch_type=PatchType.ADD,
    target_ontology="target.ttl",
    content="patch content"
)

# Apply a patch
patch_manager.apply_patch("patch-id", target_graph)

# Validate a patch
is_valid = patch_manager.validate_patch("patch-id")

# Load/Save patches
patch = patch_manager.load_patch("patch-id")
patch_manager.save_patch(patch)
```

### 3. Validation Rules

The system implements comprehensive validation:

- SHACL validation for structural integrity
- Semantic validation for consistency
- Syntax validation for correctness
- Integration validation for compatibility

### 4. Integration with CI/CD

The patch system integrates with CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**:
   - Validate patch format
   - Check patch content
   - Verify patch metadata

2. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Run all validation tests
   - Apply patches in test environment
   - Generate validation reports

3. **CD Pipeline**:
   - Apply approved patches
   - Update version information
   - Generate deployment reports

## Usage Guidelines

### Creating Patches

1. Use semantic web tools (not text editors) for patch creation
2. Follow the patch template structure
3. Include all required metadata
4. Validate before submission

### Applying Patches

1. Verify patch status is APPROVED
2. Run validation checks
3. Apply in test environment first
4. Monitor application process
5. Verify results

### Validation Process

1. Syntax validation
2. SHACL validation
3. Semantic validation
4. Integration testing
5. Performance impact assessment

## Performance Metrics

### Docker Build Metrics

- Base image size: ~500MB
- Final image size: ~1.2GB
- Build time: ~5 minutes
- Layer optimization: 4 stages

### Patch Application Metrics

- Average patch size: 10-50KB
- Application time: <1s
- Validation time: 2-5s
- Memory usage: <100MB

## Development Setup

1. Install development environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment-dev.yml
   ```

2. Activate environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate ontology-framework-dev
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Version

1. Update patch format:
   - Use new namespace: `http://example.org/ontology/`
   - Include all required metadata
   - Follow new validation rules

2. Update CI/CD configuration:
   - Add new validation steps
   - Update deployment process
   - Configure monitoring

3. Update development environment:
   - Use new environment-dev.yml
   - Install new dependencies
   - Configure new tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Patch Validation Failures**:
   - Check patch format
   - Verify required metadata
   - Run validation tests

2. **Application Failures**:
   - Check target ontology
   - Verify patch content
   - Check permissions

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Check patch size
   - Verify optimization settings

## Future Improvements

1. Enhanced validation rules
2. Improved performance metrics
3. Better integration with CI/CD
4. More comprehensive documentation
5. Additional patch types and statuses
