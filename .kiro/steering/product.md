# Product Overview

## Spore Validation Framework & Ontology Framework

This is a comprehensive framework for managing, validating, and governing ontologies with a focus on modular, traceable governance patterns called "spores."

### Core Purpose
- **Ontology Management**: Provides tools for creating, validating, and maintaining RDF/OWL ontologies
- **Spore Governance**: Implements a modular governance system where changes and patterns are encapsulated as traceable "spores"
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Integrates with MCP for AI-assisted ontology development and validation
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Works with both local RDF stores and Oracle RDF databases

### Key Features
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Natural language ontology chat, SPARQL generation, and pattern recognition
- **Advanced Validation**: Semantic consistency checking, performance analysis, and coverage assessment
- **Collaborative Tools**: Change impact analysis, conflict resolution, and review workflows
- **Code Generation**: Automatic Python classes, Pydantic models, and REST API generation
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing, deployment pipelines, and GitHub Actions workflows
- **Developer Experience**: Interactive exploration, template libraries, and migration tools
- **Enhanced MCP Server**: Comprehensive AI capabilities through Model Context Protocol
- **Multi-Backend Support**: GraphDB, Oracle RDF, and local storage options
- **Spore Governance**: Modular transformation patterns with traceability and validation

### Target Users
- Ontology engineers and knowledge graph developers
- Data architects working with semantic technologies
- Teams implementing governance frameworks for knowledge assets
- Researchers and practitioners in semantic web technologies
