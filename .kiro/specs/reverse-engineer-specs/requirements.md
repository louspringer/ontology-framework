# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automatic reverse engineering of specifications from existing code implementations in the ontology framework repository. The system will analyze Python modules, ontology files, configuration files, and documentation to extract requirements, design patterns, and implementation details, then generate structured specification documents that can be used for maintenance, onboarding, and future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically generate specification documents from existing code implementations, so that I can understand system requirements without manually analyzing complex codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a Python module path THEN the system SHALL analyze the module's classes, functions, and docstrings to extract functional requirements
2. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL identify user stories based on method names, parameters, and return types
3. WHEN processing implementation files THEN the system SHALL generate acceptance criteria in EARS format based on code behavior
4. WHEN multiple related files are analyzed THEN the system SHALL group related functionality into coherent requirements sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to extract design patterns and architectural decisions from existing implementations, so that I can document the system architecture for new team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing class hierarchies THEN the system SHALL identify design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.)
2. WHEN processing module dependencies THEN the system SHALL generate component diagrams showing system architecture
3. WHEN examining configuration files THEN the system SHALL extract deployment and infrastructure requirements
4. WHEN analyzing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL document interface specifications and data models

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to generate implementation task lists from existing code structure, so that I can create actionable development plans for similar features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reverse engineering is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a task breakdown structure based on code organization
2. WHEN analyzing test files THEN the system SHALL identify testing strategies and create corresponding task items
3. WHEN processing CI/CD configurations THEN the system SHALL extract deployment and integration tasks
4. WHEN examining error handling patterns THEN the system SHALL generate tasks for robust error management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a knowledge engineer, I want to analyze ontology files and SPARQL queries to extract semantic requirements, so that I can document knowledge representation decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing TTL files THEN the system SHALL extract class hierarchies and property definitions as functional requirements
2. WHEN analyzing SPARQL queries THEN the system SHALL identify data access patterns and query requirements
3. WHEN examining SHACL shapes THEN the system SHALL generate validation and constraint requirements
4. WHEN processing spore patterns THEN the system SHALL document governance and transformation requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to analyze MCP server implementations to understand AI integration capabilities, so that I can document AI-assisted development features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing MCP tool definitions THEN the system SHALL extract AI capability requirements
2. WHEN processing chat and assistant modules THEN the system SHALL document natural language interface requirements
3. WHEN examining code generation tools THEN the system SHALL identify automation and scaffolding requirements
4. WHEN analyzing validation frameworks THEN the system SHALL extract quality assurance and testing requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want to automatically update specification documents when code changes, so that documentation stays synchronized with implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code files are modified THEN the system SHALL detect changes and update corresponding specification sections
2. WHEN new modules are added THEN the system SHALL generate new requirement sections automatically
3. WHEN functions are removed THEN the system SHALL mark corresponding requirements as deprecated
4. WHEN API signatures change THEN the system SHALL update acceptance criteria to reflect new behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to validate that implementations match their specifications, so that I can ensure code-spec alignment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing specs to code THEN the system SHALL identify missing implementations for documented requirements
2. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN the system SHALL verify that acceptance criteria have corresponding tests
3. WHEN examining error handling THEN the system SHALL validate that edge cases are properly implemented
4. WHEN processing configuration THEN the system SHALL ensure deployment requirements are met in actual setup files
