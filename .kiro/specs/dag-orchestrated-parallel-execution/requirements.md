# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) orchestrated parallel execution system that enhances the existing parallel test generator with intelligent dependency management, optimized scheduling, and resource-aware execution. The system will provide a foundation for executing any type of parallel tasks with complex dependencies, starting with test execution but extensible to other workflows like ontology validation, code generation, and CI/CD pipelines.

**Governance Alignment**: This system implements physics-informed architecture principles with mathematical DAG validation as the non-negotiable foundation. All components follow the Beastly Module pattern (ReflectiveModule) for systematic observability, and the coordinator-worker architecture for pure orchestration without direct execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: DAG-Based Task Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define task dependencies in a DAG structure, so that tasks execute in the correct order while maximizing parallelism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user defines task dependencies THEN the system SHALL create a DAG representation of the execution plan
2. WHEN the DAG contains cycles THEN the system SHALL detect and report the circular dependency error
3. WHEN tasks have no dependencies THEN the system SHALL execute them immediately in parallel
4. WHEN a task completes successfully THEN the system SHALL make its dependent tasks eligible for execution
5. WHEN a task fails THEN the system SHALL handle failure propagation according to configured policies

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Task Scheduling and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the orchestrator to intelligently schedule tasks based on available resources and task characteristics, so that system resources are utilized efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts task execution THEN it SHALL analyze available CPU, memory, and I/O resources
2. WHEN scheduling tasks THEN the system SHALL consider task resource requirements and estimated duration
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize tasks based on criticality and dependencies
4. WHEN tasks are CPU-bound THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent execution to available CPU cores
5. WHEN tasks are I/O-bound THEN the system SHALL allow higher concurrency levels
6. WHEN resource usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL throttle new task execution

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Execution Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the system to dynamically optimize execution based on runtime performance data, so that overall execution time is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are executing THEN the system SHALL collect performance metrics for each task
2. WHEN similar tasks show consistent performance patterns THEN the system SHALL use historical data for scheduling
3. WHEN the critical path changes during execution THEN the system SHALL reprioritize remaining tasks
4. WHEN tasks complete faster than expected THEN the system SHALL increase parallelism for dependent tasks
5. WHEN tasks are slower than expected THEN the system SHALL adjust resource allocation dynamically

### Requirement 4: Fault Tolerance and Recovery

**User Story:** As a reliability engineer, I want the system to handle task failures gracefully with configurable recovery strategies, so that partial failures don't compromise the entire execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task fails THEN the system SHALL execute the configured failure handling strategy
2. WHEN retry is configured THEN the system SHALL retry failed tasks up to the specified limit
3. WHEN a task fails permanently THEN the system SHALL mark dependent tasks as blocked or skipped
4. WHEN partial execution is acceptable THEN the system SHALL continue executing independent task branches
5. WHEN failure isolation is enabled THEN the system SHALL prevent cascading failures across task groups

### Requirement 5: Real-time Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want comprehensive real-time monitoring of DAG execution, so that I can track progress and diagnose issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DAG execution starts THEN the system SHALL provide real-time execution status updates
2. WHEN tasks change state THEN the system SHALL emit structured events for monitoring systems
3. WHEN execution progress is requested THEN the system SHALL report completion percentage and ETA
4. WHEN bottlenecks occur THEN the system SHALL identify and report performance constraints
5. WHEN execution completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed execution summary and metrics

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Test Generation System

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want the DAG orchestrator to seamlessly integrate with the parallel test generator, so that test execution benefits from intelligent scheduling and dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test suites are generated THEN the system SHALL analyze test dependencies and create appropriate DAG structures
2. WHEN tests have setup/teardown dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure proper execution ordering
3. WHEN tests share fixtures or resources THEN the system SHALL optimize resource usage and prevent conflicts
4. WHEN test execution is requested THEN the system SHALL use DAG orchestration for optimal parallel execution
5. WHEN test results are available THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing result reporting mechanisms

### Requirement 7: Extensible Task Execution Framework

**User Story:** As a framework developer, I want a pluggable task execution system, so that different types of work can be orchestrated using the same DAG infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new task types are defined THEN the system SHALL support pluggable task executors
2. WHEN task executors are registered THEN the system SHALL validate their interface compliance
3. WHEN tasks require different execution environments THEN the system SHALL support containerized execution
4. WHEN custom resource requirements are specified THEN the system SHALL honor them during scheduling
5. WHEN task execution patterns change THEN the system SHALL adapt without requiring core changes

### Requirement 8: Mathematical Governance and DAG Consistency

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want mathematical DAG validation as the non-negotiable foundation, so that all execution is mathematically sound and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any task dependencies are defined THEN the system SHALL enforce DAG compliance using mathematical validation
2. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL reject execution and provide decomposition guidance
3. WHEN DAG validation passes THEN the system SHALL guarantee topological ordering exists and is unique
4. WHEN execution proceeds THEN the system SHALL maintain mathematical invariants throughout
5. WHEN complexity overwhelms human reasoning THEN the system SHALL fall back to mathematical constraints as the escape hatch to sanity

### Requirement 9: Systematic Observability Through Beastly Module Pattern

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want all DAG orchestration components to inherit systematic observability, so that monitoring and debugging are consistent across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DAG orchestration components are created THEN they SHALL inherit from ReflectiveModule (Beastly Module pattern)
2. WHEN components are deployed THEN they SHALL automatically provide Prometheus metrics, health endpoints, and structured logging
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled systematically with correlation IDs and audit trails
4. WHEN performance monitoring is needed THEN it SHALL be available automatically without additional infrastructure
5. WHEN debugging is required THEN systematic observability SHALL provide complete traceability

### Requirement 10: Configuration and Policy Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want flexible configuration options for execution policies, so that the system can be tuned for different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN execution policies are configured THEN the system SHALL validate configuration completeness and correctness
2. WHEN resource limits are specified THEN the system SHALL enforce them during execution
3. WHEN retry policies are defined THEN the system SHALL apply them consistently across all task types
4. WHEN execution profiles are selected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate optimization strategies
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply them to new executions without restart
