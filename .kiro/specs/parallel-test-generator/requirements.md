# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables automatic generation and parallel execution of comprehensive unit tests for any codebase or specification. The system will analyze code implementations, extract testable behaviors, generate appropriate test cases, and execute them in parallel to provide rapid feedback. This system will be used to generate unit tests for the reverse-engineer-specs feature and other components in the ontology framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically generate comprehensive unit tests from my code implementations, so that I can ensure thorough test coverage without manually writing every test case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python module is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate unit tests for all public methods and functions
2. WHEN analyzing class hierarchies THEN the system SHALL create tests for inheritance behavior and polymorphism
3. WHEN processing function signatures THEN the system SHALL generate tests for various input combinations and edge cases
4. WHEN detecting error handling patterns THEN the system SHALL create tests for exception scenarios and error conditions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to execute generated tests concurrently using async/await patterns, so that I can get rapid feedback on code quality and test results without subprocess overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing test suites THEN the system SHALL run tests concurrently using asyncio and thread pools
2. WHEN tests are running THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates and status information
3. WHEN concurrent execution completes THEN the system SHALL aggregate results and generate comprehensive reports
4. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and stack traces

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to generate tests from specifications and requirements, so that I can validate that implementations match their documented behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requirements documents THEN the system SHALL generate tests for each acceptance criteria
2. WHEN analyzing EARS format requirements THEN the system SHALL create parameterized tests for WHEN/IF/THEN scenarios
3. WHEN examining design documents THEN the system SHALL generate integration tests for component interactions
4. WHEN processing task lists THEN the system SHALL create tests that validate task completion criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a continuous integration engineer, I want to integrate test generation into CI/CD pipelines, so that new code automatically gets comprehensive test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are detected THEN the system SHALL generate tests for modified components
2. WHEN running in CI environments THEN the system SHALL optimize test generation for build time constraints
3. WHEN test generation completes THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing test frameworks (pytest, unittest)
4. WHEN CI builds run THEN the system SHALL provide test coverage metrics and quality reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want to customize test generation templates and patterns, so that I can adapt the system to different testing strategies and frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring test generation THEN the system SHALL support custom test templates for different patterns
2. WHEN analyzing specific code patterns THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate test generation strategies
3. WHEN generating tests THEN the system SHALL support multiple testing frameworks and assertion styles
4. WHEN customizing behavior THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of test complexity and coverage levels

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with ontologies, I want to generate tests for RDF/OWL code and SPARQL queries, so that I can validate semantic web implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing ontology files THEN the system SHALL generate tests for class definitions and property constraints
2. WHEN processing SPARQL queries THEN the system SHALL create tests with sample data and expected results
3. WHEN examining SHACL shapes THEN the system SHALL generate validation tests for constraint compliance
4. WHEN testing MCP tools THEN the system SHALL create tests for tool registration and handler functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor test generation and execution performance, so that I can optimize resource usage and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating tests THEN the system SHALL track generation time and resource consumption
2. WHEN executing tests concurrently THEN the system SHALL monitor thread pool usage and async task performance
3. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and optimization suggestions
4. WHEN running large test suites THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent concurrency limits and resource management
