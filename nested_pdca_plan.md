# Nested PDCA Structure for Continuous Improvement

## Overview
This document outlines our nested PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) approach for continuous improvement across multiple areas of focus. Each area has its own PDCA cycle, while a master PDCA cycle coordinates and tracks progress across all areas.

## Areas of Focus

### 1. Logging and Error Handling
- **Current Status**: Cycle 2
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-04
- **Next Cycle Focus**: Enhanced error correlation and structured logging
- **PDCA Steps**:
  - PLAN: Define error correlation patterns and logging standards
  - DO: Implement correlation tracking and structured logging
  - CHECK: Verify error tracking and log analysis
  - ACT: Document improvements and plan next cycle

### 2. Test Coverage
- **Current Status**: Cycle 1
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-04
- **Next Cycle Focus**: Unit test coverage and integration tests
- **PDCA Steps**:
  - PLAN: Identify critical paths and coverage gaps
  - DO: Implement test cases and coverage tools
  - CHECK: Analyze coverage reports and test results
  - ACT: Address gaps and plan next cycle

### 3. Code Quality
- **Current Status**: Cycle 1
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-04
- **Next Cycle Focus**: Code style and documentation
- **PDCA Steps**:
  - PLAN: Define quality metrics and standards
  - DO: Implement linting and documentation tools
  - CHECK: Review code quality reports
  - ACT: Address issues and plan next cycle

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Current Status**: Cycle 1
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-04
- **Next Cycle Focus**: Response time and resource usage
- **PDCA Steps**:
  - PLAN: Identify performance bottlenecks
  - DO: Implement optimizations
  - CHECK: Measure performance improvements
  - ACT: Document changes and plan next cycle

## Master PDCA Cycle

### PLAN Phase
- Coordinate PDCA cycles across all areas
- Set overall improvement goals
- Allocate resources and set timelines

### DO Phase
- Execute PDCA cycles in each area
- Monitor progress and dependencies
- Maintain documentation

### CHECK Phase
- Review progress across all areas
- Analyze interdependencies
- Identify cross-cutting issues

### ACT Phase
- Adjust cycles based on findings
- Update overall strategy
- Plan next iteration

## Tracking and Documentation
- Each area maintains its own documentation
- Master cycle tracks overall progress
- Regular reviews and updates

## Next Steps
1. Begin new PDCA cycles in each area
2. Set up tracking mechanisms
3. Schedule regular review meetings
